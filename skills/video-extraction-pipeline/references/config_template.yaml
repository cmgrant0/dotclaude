# CUSTOMIZATION NOTES:
#
# 1. Model Selection:
#    - Use gemini-2.5-pro for highest quality extraction
#    - Use gemini-2.5-flash for 40% cost savings with slightly lower quality
#
# 2. Rate Limiting:
#    - Free tier: Set to 60 seconds minimum
#    - Paid tier: Can reduce to 2-5 seconds
#
# 3. Course Context:
#    - Replace with description of your specific course
#    - Include teaching style, target audience, and key themes
#    - This helps Gemini understand context and extract better
#
# 4. Prompt Template:
#    - For other content types (technical, business, fitness, etc.)
#    - See references/prompt_library.md for 10+ specialized templates
#    - Copy the relevant template and customize for your needs
#
# 5. Video List:
#    - LOCAL FILES: Use 'path' with relative paths from scripts/ directory
#    - YOUTUBE VIDEOS: Use 'youtube_url' with full YouTube URL
#    - Mix both types in the same config file!
#    - YouTube limitations: Only public videos, 8-hour daily limit per account
#    - Recommended structure: mirror video folder organization for local files
#    - Include descriptive titles and section labels for better metadata
